#### (Situation, Mission, Execute, Admin, Comm)

### Situation

Once the user encounters an issue with a product then it's the support services that will improve the users overall experience. The Support Ticket Services serves as a customer facing open line of communication and product troubleshooting.

A staff member and user can create a note on the ticket and close it if solved.
